1...heap sort====create heap of n elements+delete n elements of heap----nlogn+nlogn=2nlogn---O(nlogn)
     
   inserting an ele in a heap
-------------------------------
 the idea is we will divide array into 2 division.the 1st division is heap area and the second division is non heap area
   we will take every element of non heap area and we will find position in heap area and we will insert it
  
  deleting an ele in a heap
-------------------------------------
the only element we can delete from heap is only root element(that is 1st ele of array)
----first we will swap first  and last element and decreased the heap size(so that we can assume an ele is deleted from heap)
         now the only thing that we want to do is adjust the elements of heap
