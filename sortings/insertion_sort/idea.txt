1...the idea is we will divide the array into 2 parts.first part indicates sorted array and second part indicates
      unsorted array
     at every  time we will take the element of unsorted array and we will find the position in sorted array
       and we will insert the element.
     **i--(1---<n)
        it is default adaptive so that min--O(n) and max--O(n2)
