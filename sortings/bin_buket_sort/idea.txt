1...it is exactly same as count sort but with a small difference---O(n)
      here we will take a array(b) with size (max+1)
        and we will not maintain any frequencies.instead of mataining frequencies we will maintain elements itself
          either by list or by linked list
   space---huge space when compared with count sort
