1...at every pass(outer loop) the smallest element will moved to the start of the array
     i=(0---<n-1)
     j=(i+1---<n)
     k=i
   the idea is if a[j]<a[k]
                then move k to j
             finally k represents smallest element so interchange a[k] and a[i]
    it is not adaptive---O(n2)
