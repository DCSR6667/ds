1...the first approach is---O(kn)---O(1) 
       we want to take last element and it should be inserted in first position--this should be
         repeated k times
      
      in this above approach  if we modify k=k%len then--O(n+n(k%len))--O(n(k%len))





2...1 first find the length of linked list---O(n+n-(k%l))--O(n)--space--O(1)
    2 make it as circular linked list
    3 k=k%len and pos=len-k
    4 now go to that position change head and cut the link
