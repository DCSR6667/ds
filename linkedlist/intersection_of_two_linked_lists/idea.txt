****in this problem we will not compare data we will compare entire nodes
1...the first approach is brute force approach---O(m*n)
    we will take one node and compare the address  of the another node

2..first we will take one linked list and store  all the nodes in a set data structure--O(m+n)--space--O(n)
   now we will traverse through another linked list and we will check if node is available in set or not
         if it is available then return it
3..first we will find lengths of two linked lists simulatnneously---O(m+m-n+n)--O(2m)---space--O(1)
