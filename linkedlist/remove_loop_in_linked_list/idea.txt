this problem can be solve by using finding loop concepts

1...take a empty set and two pointers curr=head and prev=None--O(n)--space---O(n)
      
        while curr:
            if curr not in s:
                s.add(curr)
                prev=curr
                curr=curr.next
                
            else:
                break
        prev.next=None

2....first use two pointers slow and fast and find loop after that follow below procedure--O(n)--space--O(1)*
         
            if slow is head:
                while fast.next!=slow:
                    fast=fast.next
                fast.next=None
            elif slow is fast:
                slow=head
                while slow.next!=fast.next:
                    slow=slow.next
                    fast=fast.next
                fast.next=None
