1...perform linear search on the matrix it will take ---O(m*n)
2..take one row of matrix and perform binary search repeat this procedure---O(mlogn)
3..in the question they given elements are sorted from row wise and column wise so we use this concept--O(m+n)
    take two pointers i=0 j=len(matrix[0])-1
             if matrix[i][j]==target:
                return True
             elif matrix[i][j]>target:
                   j--
             else
                   i++
           repeat this until i<n and j>=0



4..in the question they given That first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous 
      row so we use this concept 
          
       ** from this we can say that  if all elements are arranged in linear manner then they are sorted in ascending order
            so we  will apply a binary search on this matrix---O(logmn)
