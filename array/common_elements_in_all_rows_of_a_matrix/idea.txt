1...take a dictionary and insert all the elements of first row with their respectively frequencies---O(m*n)  space--O(n)
        now our dict contains first row elements along with their frequnecies
        now traverse from second row and check
                   if the element is in dict and dict[ele]=row(to avoid duplicates frequencies)
                        dict[ele]+=1
         finally we will traverse through dict and we will check 
                    if dict[ele]==m:
                        print(ele)
