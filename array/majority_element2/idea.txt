1...take two loops and try to find out(brute force approach)----O(n2)
2...use dictionary and try to make frequency----O(n)---space--O(n)

3...counting and cancelling method in this we will take one loop ---O(n)
     n//k if k==2 then there exists  max one majority ele that why we use ele and count
          if k==3 then there exists  maximum two majority elements that why we use 4 variables ele1,ele2,count1,count2
