1....concept-----------
      two intervals l1 and l2 are merged if and only if
              l1[1]==l2[0] or l1[1]>l2[0]
      merging interval---------------
        [l1[0],max(l1[1],l2[1])]
  problem------------------------
let us take varaible res=interval[0] and a empty list=[] and sort the intervals
  take a element of interval and check merging is possible with res or not
   ***if merging is possible then perform merging and assigned to res and move to next ele of interval
   ***if merging is not possible then append res to list and res=ele and move to next ele of interval
after finishing the entire loop then append the res to list---o(nlogn+n)
