1...take two loops and try this----O(n2)
2...concept a+b=sum so b=sum-a---------O(n)
 take a dictionary
         check sum-a is in dict
           if available 
              count=count+d[sum-i] 
           add the element in the dictionary if it is not there.if it is there increment the frequency count of the element
