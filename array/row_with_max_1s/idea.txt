1..first approach is bruteforce approach it will take O(m*n)
2..take every row and perform binary search and find count(based on some calculation) and return it--O(mlogn)
3..in this question they given that every row is sorted so we use it
        now take 2 pointers i=0 and j=len(arr[0])-1
              while i<n and j>=0:
            	if arr[i][j]==1:
                		maxrow=i
                		j-=1
            	else:
                		i+=1
        	 return maxrow
