1...take two loops i starts from (o-n) and j starts from (i+1--n) and check the condition and do it---O(n2)
2..a+b=target then b=target-a this is the idea---O(n)
      we will take a empty dictionary 
      we will traverse every element of nums and check b is available in dict
          if available return indexes
          if not available then add the element and index in the dictionary
