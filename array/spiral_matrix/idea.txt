1...this problem can be solved by using five pointers like (dir,top,down,left,right)----O(m*n)  space--O(m+n)
   when dir=0 then we will traverse from left to right
        dir=1 then we will traverse from top to  down
        dir=2 then we will traverse from right to left
        dir=3 then we will traverse from down to top
    update dir=(dir+1)%4
