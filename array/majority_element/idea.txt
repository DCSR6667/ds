1...take two loops and try to find out(brute force approach)----O(n2)
2...use dictionary and try to make frequency----O(n)---space--O(n)
3..sort the array and return nums[len(nums)//2]---O(nlogn)
4...counting and cancelling method in this we will take one loop and two  varaiables count and ele---O(n)
        if count==0:
            ele=nums[i]
        if ele==nums[i]
           count++
        else:
            count---
 finally ele represents the majority element
