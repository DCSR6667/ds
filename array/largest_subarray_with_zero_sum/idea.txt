1....we can solve it simply by using two loops---O(n2)
2... by maintaining prefix sum dictionary(with key as prefix sum and value as index so that we can maintain length) ---O(n)
            if sum is zero then it have to meet this condition
            *prefix sum of any ele is 0
            *if two eles have same prefix sum
            *arr[i]==0
