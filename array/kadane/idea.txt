1.....take two loops let i starts from 0-(n-1) and let j starts from i-(n-1) and take two varaibles max ans sum and try it------O(n2)
2.....by using sliding window pattern---O(n)
       calculate window sum and update max_sum
       but whenever window sum is negative then take sum=0 because if we
       add negative sum to next contiguous array then we wont get maximum subarray
