1...use sort function--o(nlogn)
2..use heap concept
      smallest,minimum,closest------max heap
      largest,maximum,longest,----minheap
    
     
	from the above we can know that we want use max heap------------nlog(k+1)
         take 1 by 1 element of arr and insert into maxheap
            and if sizeofheap>k   --here we restrict the size of heap to k
                  then pop an element form an heap
       then finally heap[0] gives kth smallest element
