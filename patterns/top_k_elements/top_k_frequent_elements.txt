1..this problem can be solved by using heap and we will use
    dict to maintain count

     (largest element--use min heap-----time--O(nlogk+n+k)--space--O(n+k)
     smallest element--use max heap
       and we will restrict the size of heap so that 
        insert--O(logk) and delete--O(logk)
        and the size of heap will be--O(k))
