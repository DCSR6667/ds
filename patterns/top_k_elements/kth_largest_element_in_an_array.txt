1..the first approach is by using sort fun--O(nlogn)
2..second approach is by using heap
     heapify method---O(nlogk+klogn)
          (or)
     (largest element--use min heap-----time--O(nlogk)--space--O(k)
     smallest element--use max heap
       and we will restrict the size of heap  to k so that 
        insert--O(logk) and delete--O(logk)
        and the size of heap will be--O(k))
           
3..third approach is by  quickselect(quicksort by some limitation)--O(n) as average case
