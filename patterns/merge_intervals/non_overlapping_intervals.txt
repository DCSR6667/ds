1...first sort the list based on start index---O(nlogn)--space--O(1)
   take two pointers  and do it
   

     logic----------------------------------------
        end>=start then overlapping occurs
      
    the idea is very simple whenever an overlapp exists then
    remove the interval with max end so that  interval may not overlap with 
    other intervals
 
      1........   2..........
      
            3.......      
     whenever 1 and 3 overlaps then remove 3 so that it may not overlap 
      with 2
      
     in this we generally wont remove the interval.we will use 
      prevend variable and we will do it
