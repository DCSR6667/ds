1....this problem can be solved by using merge sort----O(nklogk)--O(1)
     it is same as merge sort with out any change..k--> represents height of tree

2...this problem can be solved by using heap


       heapify method---O(kn)
          (or)
     (largest element--use min heap-----time--O(nklogk)--space--O(kn)
     smallest element--use max heap
       and we will restrict the size of heap  to k so that 
        insert--O(logk) and delete--O(logk)
        and the size of heap will be--O(k))
