1...this problem can be solved by using heap------time--O(m+klogm)--space--O(m)
     where m represents no of sorted lists
   
      (largest element--use min heap
     smallest element--use max heap
       **and we will restrict the size of heap  to m so that 
        insert--O(logm) and delete--O(logm)
        and the size of heap will be--O(m))

2.second method by using binary search---time--O(nlog(maxval))--O(n)--space--O(1)
