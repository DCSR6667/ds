1...this problem can be solved by using heap------time--O(k+knlogk)--O(k)
  
   in this problem we want to find lowest value of max-min.if we increase the min value
    then we will get lowest value of max-min
    
      (largest element--use min heap
     smallest element--use max heap
       **and we will restrict the size of heap  to m so that 
        insert--O(logm) and delete--O(logm)
        and the size of heap will be--O(m))
