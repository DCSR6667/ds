1...take a set and traverse through the linked list  and check ---O(n)--space--O(n)
          if node is  available in set then return true
          if node is not available in set then add it to the set
    this process is until temp is not None if temp is None then return False

2..take two pointers they are slow and fast pointers--O(n)--space--O(1)
       slow move by 1 unit and fast move by 2 units
       if slow==fast then return True 
          this process is continued until fast,fast.next is not None.if they are None then return False
