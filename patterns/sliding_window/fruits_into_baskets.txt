1...this can be solved by sliding window pattern---O(n)---O(1)
      
     
        l,r=0,0
        max_len=0
        dict={}
    add every element into dict along with indexes and update max_len
      ***but whenever len of dict is >=3  --->importtant step 
         then
         we want to delete key-val pair in dict
         we want to update l


****this question is similar to longest substring with atmost k distinct characters
