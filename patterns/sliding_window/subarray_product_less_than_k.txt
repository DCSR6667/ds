1..it is a sliding window problem-----O(n)
  
   **in this we will predict no of subarrays by sliding window length
       that is r-l+1
  
    at first we will upadate prod and we will update count
    whenever prod>=k then we will remove left most ele fro prod and we will inc l+=1
    

       while r<len(nums):
            prod*=nums[r]
            while prod>=k:
                prod/=nums[l]
                l+=1
            
            count+=r-l+1
            r+=1
