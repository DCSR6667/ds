1...take two loops i(0---n-1) and j(i+1---n-1) and update profit variable based on some logic ---o(n2)
2....this can be solved by sliding window pattern--O(n)
      take two pointers which represents sides of window
      l,r=0,1
      profit=0
      take a loop r<len(p):
      if p[l]>p[r]:   
       l=r
       r+=1
      else:
       update profit and increment r
      return profit
