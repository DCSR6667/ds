this is solved by using sliding window----O(n)
it is exactly same as friuts into basket question (or)
longest substring with atmost k distinct characters question with small difference
that is in this we will update the max_len if and only if
len(dict)==k  --->this implies that given substring contains exactly k distinct characters
