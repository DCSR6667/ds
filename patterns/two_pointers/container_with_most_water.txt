1..the first appraoch is brute force approach---O(n2)
   in this we will take two loops 
   and we will claculate area and we will update maxarea based on some logic

2..the second approach is two pointers approach--O(n)
   we will take two pointers l,h=0,end
       while l<h:
            area=(h-l)*min(height[l],height[h])
            if area>maxarea:
                maxarea=area
            if height[l]<height[h]:
                l+=1
            else:
                h-=1
        return maxarea
